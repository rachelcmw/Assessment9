Group Assessment on Decision Trees

Contributors: Carol Lopez, James McSweeney, Zeeshan Pervaiz, Rachel Walter

Summary: Our task for this project was to learn about Decision Trees. The first part was to conduct research on the algorithm and learn how it works, and the second part was to apply what we learned and use the algorithm on three separate datasets and compare its performance to Logistic Regression. 

Data: The datasets we worked with for this project were found on Kaggle. The Datasets utilized were:

- Cars93: This is a dataset on cars and their attributes such as model, manufacturer, price and MPG (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashpaloswal/cars93).
- Carseats: This is a dataset on car seats and the locations who sold them and contains attributes such as price, sales, the community's average income, and average age of the local population (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/huhao05133/carseats).
- Diabetes: This dataset is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, it was used to predict if patients had diabetes or not (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset).
